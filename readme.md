## About Me
Hi everyone! I am Leslie White and I am excited to be learning along side each of you this semester. This is my last course in the _Learning Design and Technology_ program. I am looking forward to graduation in May. I teach middle school in [Wake County](http://www.wcpss.net) and have been teaching online courses for NCVPS, as well as working in professional development for several years.

## Hobbies

I am the **proud mom** of two amazing girls. I am also married and we are big **Wolfpack** fans!  When I am not working, I love to spend time with family, travel, cook, and read.
